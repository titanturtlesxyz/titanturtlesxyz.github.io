### CYBERPATRIOT 2022-2023 ROUND 4 (SEMIFINAL ROUND) COMPETITION: JAN 21, 2023
The semifinal round is what determines whether, the teams make Nationals. Although, the images have various predetermined rankings, all were super hard, only Ubuntu was hard, we can gain a more accurate understanding of the image difficulty by looking at the public scores. Fedora in this case was Extremely hard, as 99% of teams got less than 10 points on it. Ubuntu although now only marked hard, was harder than the State Round Ubuntu which was marked superhard. Windows and Windows Server were relatively easier and was where all the points were got. The Boeing Challenge were points that team's must obtain, the web challenge had one super hard part and a relatively easier part. The Cisco Networking Quiz was easy, but the packet tracer was super hard.
